## üëâ What you will learn <a name="what-you-will-learn"></a>
	‚Ä¢ DCL Commands such as REVOKE and GRANT
	‚Ä¢ Creating and dropping views
	‚Ä¢ Using inner and outer joins
	‚Ä¢ Using set operators (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT)
	‚Ä¢ Using subqueries


### <u>NOTE</u>: 

* DCL is data control language, it is used to control user access to data stored in database. 
* GRANT command is used to give permission to user to access the database, tables, views, and other database objects.
* REVOKE command is used to withdraw the access to the database, tables, views, and other database objects.
* Make sure to use hostname while creating user, granting, and revoking permissions. Ex: 'username'@'hostname' instead of just 'username'
* Views are used for security and simplicity. 
* It is not possible to create index on views. Views takes the advantage of indexes created on underlying table. 
* Views do not create physical table with memory footprint, it is only virtual logical table. 
* If underlying table is altered view needs to be modified accordingly. 
* ON clause is interchangeable with USING clause when joining key/ column names are similar.
* If JOIN type is not specified then database defaults to INNER JOIN
* MySQL does not support FULL JOIN but it can be achieved using LEFT JOIN, UNION, and RIGHT JOIN.
* LEFT JOIN is same as LEFT OUTER JOIN and RIGHT JOIN is same as RIGHT OUTER JOIN.
